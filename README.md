Write high-quality, interactive blog posts in markdown, live.

## In a nutshell
- write in markdown optionally including html
- start a codeblock with `// @run` to auto-execute
- optionally specify title and head block (e.g. custom styles or scripts outside of core post)

## Getting started

There are two main ways mdxish can be used.

1. Convert mdxish flavored markdown into static html locally (live or one-off) or in CI/CD.
2. Put a mdxish flavored markdown file called `index.md` in a gist, copy the gist id, and go to `https://mdxish.com/{gistId}`

For example:

```bash
npm run convert examples/falling-sand.md falling-sand.html
```

To launch a live server that will automatically keep HTML up to date with whatever you write in your mdxish flavored markdown:

```bash
npm run server -- -i examples/falling-sand.md
```
